<h1 align="center"> Python FreeCodeCamp Challenges </h1>

<h3 align="left"> Description </h3>
FreeCodeCamp is a community that promotes learning  through dozens of projects divided into steps, being possible to advance to the next step only after having successfully completed the previous step and had your code checked. So that means that all the code, although being developed in a learning environment, was entirely developed by me, and not copied.
<br>
Each project covers different concepts in python, that are listed in a "concepts.txt" file. Moreover, each project represents an implementation of an algorithm or tool that, even though simple, could be used in the real world.

1. Learn string manipulation by building a cypher<br>
2. Learn how to work with numbers and strings by implementing the luhn algorithn
3. Learn lambda functions by building an expense tracker
